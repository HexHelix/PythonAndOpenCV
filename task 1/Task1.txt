3) Write a program which asks the user to enter three points (i.e (x1,y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)) and find whether they are collinear.
	
4) Write a program to ask the user to enter a number and then print their data type (string, integer or float). [Hint: Study the function 'type'.]

	b) subtract x from y
	c) multiply x and y
	d) integer division: x by y
	e) float division: y by x
	f) square the numbers x and y
	g) raise x to the power y
	h) (x+y)^3 + (y^3)*6 - (x^y) + (x/y)

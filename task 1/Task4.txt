Implement the following programs by creating a seperate function.

1) Write a program to input a list from the user and output a list of unique elemtents.

2)Write a program to input a sentence (a string without any special characters other than whitespace) and generate a list with the words in the input sentence as its elements.
	Input: Hello there I am XYZ
	Output : [‘Hello’,’there’,’I’, ’am’, ’XYZ’]



3) Ask the user to enter 4 points and arrange them in order of their distances from the origin. 


4)Write a function which takes a list of integers and no. of rotations as input and returns a list rotated in anticlockwise order.
example: 
input: [1,2,3,4,5], 1 rotation
output: [2,3,4,5,1]
example 2:
input: [1,2,3,4,5], 2 rotations
output: [3,4,5,1,2]

5)write a program to calculate the distance between two given points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) using lambda functions

6)Study about the properties of lists, tuples and dictionaries.

Note: All the codes have to be generic and should work for any given input(Take each and every value as an input from the user).
